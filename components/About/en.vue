        Hello! My name is Mikhail, and I'm the creator of "Samomes" — a fertilizer calculator for planted tanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was born at the intersection of my professional web development skills and my childhood hobby —
        aquaristics. The project evolved gradually, along with my own experience, and continues to grow thanks to
        feedback from aquarists who use it.
      </p>

        My Journey in Aquaristics
      </h2>
      <p>
        My first aquarium appeared back in 1995 when I was in first grade. At that time, I read my first book on
        aquaristics by a German author, which described an amazing underwater world. Even then, I was very interested
        in plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 10 years of active involvement, there was a long break of 15 years. I returned to aquaristics after
        inheriting a severely neglected aquarium. And then everything resumed with new force — but at a completely
        new level (below are my tanks in chronological order).

        Birth of the Idea
      </h2>
      <p>
        The idea for the calculator appeared in 2019 when I started growing plants using modern approaches. I remember
        standing with fertilizer bottles in my hands and not knowing how to properly calculate dosages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nitrate bottle indicated nitrogen and potassium concentrations. The phosphate bottle — phosphorus and
        potassium. The micronutrient fertilizer listed many elements, including the same potassium. Plus I had a
        separate bottle of potassium. Potassium, potassium, potassium!
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of all this, the manufacturer gave different instructions on each bottle: on one — "add 2-3 times a
        week, 1-2 ml per 100 L", on another — "once a week 3-5 ml per 50 L". And potassium, as I already noticed,
        was contained in each of them. Calculating its total sum — what a pain!
      </p>

        Project Development
      </h2>
      <p>
        At first, I calculated the necessary dosages on paper several times. But when a second aquarium appeared and I
        had to recalculate everything again, it became clear — enough from me! That's how the first page with
        dosage calculations appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then it seemed to me that buying branded fertilizers was quite expensive, and they could be made
        myself. Micronutrients were complex to prepare, and their consumption was lower, so I focused on
        macroelements. That's how the recipes page appeared, and for micros I made a separate section with branded
        fertilizers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was growing, new tools were adding, and now it's not just a calculator for homemade fertilizers.
        It's a complete system that helps calculate any chemistry for aquariums and see the complete picture of
        elements, eliminating the need for infiniti testing.

        About Quality
      </h2>
      <p>
        You might ask: "What kind of growth habit and complexity of plant cultivation is discussed in a project
        named Samomes?" I'll answer — the highest level imaginable. The project sets itself the goal of helping
        achieve aquariums of maximum complexity level.
      </p>
      <p>
        All photos and videos on the site are my own aquariums or aquariums of people who use the project. The name
        "Samomes" is just historical legacy; the project has long outgrown the framework of simple DIY recipes.

        Your Journey in Aquaristics
      </h2>
      <p>
        On your journey, you will make many decisions — a planted aquarium is not that simple. I want Samomes to become
        your loyal companion in making the right decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every aquarist has their own path: some buy branded fertilizers, others make everything themselves. Even
        one person can change their views over time — as it was with me. I changed fertilizers, the number and types
        of aquariums, approaches to maintenance. Yesterday I used the recipes page, and today I'm only interested in
        preparing osmotic water. You never know what wait you ahead!
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll have to recalculate dosages hundreds, maybe thousands of times. Constantly adjust and change something.
        I want Samomes to help you with all its tools — or that one tool that's needed right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way you can get more enjoyment from your aquarium, rather than spending time on boring calculations.

      <p>
        Over the years of existence, the project has come a long way from an unknown website to a tool used by
        thousands of aquarists around the world. The geography of users is constantly expanding and has long since
        crossed the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm grateful to everyone who uses Samomes and shares their experience — your feedbacks help the
        project become better.
