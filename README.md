## About the project

The calculator simplifies the calculation of element concentrations, eliminating routine work. With it, you can:

* create your own fertilizer or remineralizer recipe, as well as use ready-made recipes
* calculate optimal dosages for both DIY and branded fertilizers for your aquarium
* create an effective fertilizer schedule
* calculate general and carbonate hardness during water changes
* track the aquarium parameters and element dynamics in the water

For any questions or suggestions, you can email me at lapshinmr@gmail.com.

I'll be happy to help.
